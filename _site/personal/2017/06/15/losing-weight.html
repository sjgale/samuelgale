    <p>Since March 2016 I’ve lost over 30 lbs, and I countinue getting in better and better shape. A few people asked what helped, so I thought I’d share my thoughts here:</p>

<h3 id="remember-your-motivation">Remember your motivation</h3>

<p>It’s important that you have motivation to improve, and that you don’t forget it. Turning that motivation into an artifact can help! Write it down and/or share it often.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s mine:</strong></p>

<p>As a youth leader in 2016, I went on a campout with some 12 and 13 year old young men. There were several moments where I couldn’t keep up with the youth I was leading. That was discouraging. I use to challenge the youth to push-up competitions and help them carry their packs on hikes. If I couldn’t keep up with the youth as a young man in his 20s, how would I be able to keep up with my kids as they - and I - get older?</p>

<p>A couple weeks later I appeared in a family member’s vlog and was shocked how out of shape I looked. I looked nothing like what I imagined - I had a growing double chin, a growing gut, and my shirt kept coming up over my love handles during an active segment. That was a tipping point, and that video, posted online for the world to see, provided a great artifact I could look back at over and over again. I still want to empty to cupboard of junk food and do push-ups every time I see that vlog.</p>

<h3 id="remember-the-formula">Remember the formula</h3>

<p>I heard all you have to do to lose weight is burn more calories than you consume. That’s really simple!</p>

<p>Think of it like a scale with calories burned on one side and calories consumed on the other. If the scale is balanced you’ll maintain weight. If the consumption side is heavier, you gain weight, if the burning side is heavier you’ll lose weight.</p>

<p>So simple: eat one less spoonful, you’ll tip the balance of the scale. Move a little more while your at work and the balance will tip further! Every movement or bite you take - or don’t take - counts.</p>

<h3 id="have-positive-internal-stories">Have positive internal stories</h3>

<p>I tell myself a few things over and over which help:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“All I have to do is move a little more and eat a little less.”</li>
  <li>“This is not impossible, just a little uncomfortable.”</li>
  <li>“A lot of small steps add up to big changes over time.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="keep-your-plan-simple">Keep your plan simple</h3>

<p>My plan is nothing extreme, and I’m OK with the slow progress I’ve made - over time it’s added up to a lot! I still treat myself to junk food and ice cream occasionally, eat pizza and burgers, just less of it. I actually tell myself to cool off and keep it simple whenever I’m tempted to do something more intense. Experience has taught me it will lead to burnout.</p>

<p>My actual plan can be broken down to four simple things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>I only occasionally get second helpings during a meal.</li>
  <li>I eat a healthier, lower calorie breakfasts. (Think oatmeal sweetened with a banana, or bran flakes instead of Fruit Loops.)</li>
  <li>I try to move more throughout the day: parking further from store entrances, standing at my desk, and working out.</li>
  <li>I don’t go out to eat as often, and try to eat smaller portions or healthier options when I do.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="have-a-community">Have a community</h3>

<p>Having my wife’s support is probably been the biggest reason I’ve actually been able to make this change. Going to the gym with her turns a chore into a fun experience. Remembering her excitement for me, even before I thought I had made any substantial progress, inspires me to put down the second donut at work.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>For me, to saying that “lifestyle change trumps dieting” has been so true! It’s taken effort to improve my lifestyle, but not <em>that</em> much and doesn’t take a ton of thought. Life is still enjoyable. Best, I feel like I could keep up what I’m currently doing for years to come!</p>
